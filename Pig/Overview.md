#### General:
* Pig is one of the Ecosystem projects of Hadoop.
* It was created by Yahoo and opensourced under Apache Software Foundation(ASF)
* It was created in year 2008/09 as ananymous project in Yahoo labs.
* Currently Pig is one of the top level projects under Apache.
* The latest releas of Pig is 0.17.0 version.

#### Summary
* Pig is dataflow language on top of Hadoop.
* Pig is a higher level abstraction on top MapReduce, Spark and Tez.
* Pig used to do data transformations on all varieties of datasets like structured, unstructured and semi structured.
* Pig is used to do batch processing. 
* Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets.
* Pig provides an engine for executing data flows in parallel on Hadoop. 
* Pig includes a language, Pig Latin, for expressing these data flows. 
* Pig Latin includes operators for many of the traditional data operations (join, sort,
  filter, etc.), as well as the ability for users to develop their own functions
  for reading, processing, and writing data.
* Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of MapReduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
  implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). 
* Pig's language layer currently consists of a textual scripting language called Pig Latin, which has the following key properties: 
  * Ease of programming 
  * Optimization
  * Extensibility
  * Productivity
  * Well tested
